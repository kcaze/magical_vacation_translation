\85\00たち: Currently translating as "\85\00 and the others", but maybe we could
drop "and the others".

"alright" vs "all right"

Ellipses are always three periods.

Colon after name of character in dialogue box for clarity. This works better
than quotation marks probably, especially since the quotation marks aren't even
closed.
