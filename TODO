- Fix truncation of equipment names on the character equip screen.
- "Unequip" needs to be drawn before the name of the item/magic to unequip is drawn.
- Fix all the x positioning for menu text.
- Change the 's' in the "Risebird Village & Spa" to a 'c'. The graphic is used in the campgrounds map.
- Hack the name stuff. The player's name is stored at 0x0202D9D0!!!
- Flickering on choosing the main character's element. This is probably due to
  redrawing the text sprites each time. The same effect is reproduced in the
  original if you try to scroll through the list of elements.
- Control characters need to be figured out and fixed in script. Currently,
  names don't work properly because of the change from 16 bytes to 32 bytes.
  Same with items. For items, debating whether or not to use control codes at
  all. Since the icon drawing is messed up too.
- Item descriptions are messed up in battle. I need to rethink how I'm going to
  approach item descriptions, since they're shared between monospace text and
  vwf text.
- See if there's a way to center the element name when choosing an element.
  Right now it looks really ugly (compare "Bug" and "Electric").
