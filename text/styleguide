Multiword items should have capitalize the first letter of each word.

Kirsche: Mimic Pico's speech style.

Pistachio should say "Meep" a lot perhaps?

"Oh ho ho" could be another way of laughing.

The "zen room" is called the "meditation room".

The home planet / realm is Kovomaka, to be consistent with Starsign.

Use "?!", not "!?"

\85\00たち: Currently translating as "\85\00 and the others", but maybe we could
drop "and the others".

"alright" vs "all right"

Colon after name of character in dialogue box for clarity. This works better
than quotation marks probably, especially since the quotation marks aren't even

カフェオレ is Mokka to be consistent with Magical Starsign.

were called Putty Peas.

Play through starsign and figure out how pyrites speak.

Keep the game E rated. In other words, avoid using "crap", "hell",
"damn", or "shit". Obviously, avoid using even stronger profanities.

I'll use the water people to encode fun messages :) They'll be vignere cipher'd
with the key "BUBBLE".

Spirits use the pronoun "it".
