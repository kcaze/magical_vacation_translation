Fonts are 8x16 at 1bpp and include 128 glyphs in ASCII order. So each font takes
up 16 bytes * 128 = 0x800 bytes.


Fonts used
==========
*script: vwf font used for script text and most other text. Obtained from http://www.romhacking.net/fonts/13/
*menu_monospace: monospace font used for menu text. Obtained from http://www.romhacking.net/fonts/108/


A table of glyph widths is included for the vwf script font since it makes writing
vwf routines easier.
